# Hello, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Serat Saad!

I am a **senior** at **Vanderbilt University**, majoring in **Physics & Mathematics** with a minor in **Astronomy & Scientific Computing** ðŸŒŒ. My journey into Astronomy began through international Olympiads, where I developed a deep love for the stars and problem-solving. Since then, my passion has driven me to publish research, present at international conferences, and lead impactful educational initiatives.

I am actively **seeking Astronomy PhD positions** where I can further explore **Astronomy**.

## ðŸŒŸ My Research Projects:
Here are some of my recent projects, highlighting my journey across Stellar Astronomy, AGN studies, and Quantum Computing:

### **Stellar Formation:**
- [**ABYSS II**: Identification of Young Stars in Optical SDSS Spectra](https://github.com/seratsaad/ABYSS-II)  
   Developed a pipeline to identify young stellar objects using SDSS optical spectra and explored their properties such as accretion activity. First author paper published in [*The Astronomical Journal*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ad2001/pdf).

- [**Veiling Measurements in BOSS Spectra**](https://github.com/seratsaad/BOSS-Veiling)  
   Investigated accretion activity in young stars using veiling as a diagnostic. Analyzed empirical veiling data for robust measurements. First author paper submitted to *The Astronomical Journal*. Presented in multiple [conferences](https://zenodo.org/records/13007730).

### **Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) & Supermassive Black Holes:**
- [**Tick Tock: An Alternative to the Supermassive Black Hole Binary Hypothesis**](https://github.com/seratsaad/ticktock)  
   Studied UV and optical spectra of J1430 to propose alternative explanations for its periodic variability. Preparing a first-author paper for *The Astrophysical Journal*.  

- [**J0950+5128: Understanding Perturbed Accretion Disks**](https://github.com/seratsaad/j0950)  
   Conducting spectral decomposition to explore the nature of this source, challenging the binary hypothesis. Preparing a paper for *The Astrophysical Journal*.

### **Quantum Computing:**
- [**Quantum Computing Education Guide**](https://github.com/seratsaad/qc-prep)  
   Co-created an open-access guide to help students and professionals learn the fundamentals of quantum computing and its applications in physics.

- [**Quantum Computing Self-Projects**](https://github.com/seratsaad/quantum-comp)  
   Exploring quantum algorithms and machine learning applications for large-scale astronomical/non-astronomical datasets. 

---

### **Graduate-Level Coursework**:
To build a strong foundation for graduate studies, Iâ€™ve completed advanced classes such as:
- [**ASTR 8080: Data Science in Large Astronomical Survey**](https://github.com/seratsaad/ASTR8080)
- [**ASTR 8060: Observational Astronomy Techniques**](https://github.com/seratsaad/astr_8060_f23) 
- [**ASTR 3890: Data Science in Astronomy**](https://github.com/seratsaad/astr3890)
